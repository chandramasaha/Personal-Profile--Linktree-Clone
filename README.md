### Description:

Website for my personal links using Linktree as reference (made for Think Digital web-dev recruitments)

It is a single-page static website that displays my personal links to various websites like LinkedIn, Instagram, Figma etc. 
The layout was inspired by Linktree. It has a soothing, pastel gradient background, clean fonts, and a minimalistic UI.

<br>
Every link opens in a new tab after a 5-second delay.

Languages: HTML, CSS and a bit of Vanilla JS.
